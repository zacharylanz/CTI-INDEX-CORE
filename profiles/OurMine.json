    "description": "OurMine is known for celebrity internet accounts, often causing cyber vandalism, to advertise their commercial services.\n(Trend Micro) In light of the recent report detailing its willingness to pay US$250,000 in exchange for the 1.5 terabytes\u2019 worth of data swiped by hackers from its servers, HBO finds itself dealing with yet another security breach.\nKnown for hijacking prominent social media accounts, the self-styled white hat hacking group OurMine took over a number of verified Twitter and Facebook accounts belonging to the cable network. These include accounts for HBO shows, such as \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d \u201cGirls,\u201d and \u201cBallers.\u201d\nThis is not the first time that OurMine has claimed responsibility for hacking high- profile social networking accounts. Last year, the group victimized Marvel, The New York Times, and even the heads of some of the biggest technology companies in the world. Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, Sundar Pichai, and Daniel Ek \u2014 the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter, Google and Spotify, respectively \u2014 have also fallen victim to the hackers, dispelling the notion that a career in software and technology exempts one from being compromised.",
