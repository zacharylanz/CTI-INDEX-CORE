They use a variety of programming languages, including C++, VBScript, and Python, to develop their malware. They have been observed using virtual private servers and compromised servers, particularly WordPress websites, in their infrastructure. While there are some minor similarities with other threat actors in the region, there is not enough evidence to make any attribution.",
