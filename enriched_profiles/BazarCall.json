    "description": "BazarCall campaigns forgo malicious links or attachments in email messages in favor of phone numbers that recipients are misled into calling. It\u2019s a technique reminiscent of vishing and tech support scams where potential victims are being cold called by the attacker, except in BazarCall\u2019s case, targeted users must dial the number.
