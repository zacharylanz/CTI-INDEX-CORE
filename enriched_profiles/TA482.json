    "description": "Since early 2022, Proofpoint researchers have observed a prolific threat actor, tracked as TA482, regularly engaging in credential harvesting campaigns that target the social media accounts of mostly US-based journalists and media organizations. This victimology, TA482\u2019s use of services originating from Turkey to host its domains and infrastructure, as well as Turkey\u2019s history of leveraging social media to spread pro-President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and pro-Justice and Development Party (Turkey\u2019s ruling party) propaganda support Proofpoint\u2019s assessment that TA482 is aligned with the Turkish state.",
