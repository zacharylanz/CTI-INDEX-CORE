    "description": "In September 2023, Cisco Talos identified a new malware family that it calls \u2018HTTPSnoop\u2019 being deployed against telecommunications providers in the Middle East. They also discovered a sister implant to 'HTTPSnoop,\u2019 that they are naming \u2018PipeSnoop,\u2019 which can accept arbitrary shellcode from a named pipe and execute it on the infected endpoint. Based on these findings, the researchers assess with high confidence that both implants belong to a new intrusion set that it named \u2018ShroudedSnooper.\u2019",
